This book began as a series of lecture notes for an in- troductory astronomy course I have been teaching at the University of Bonn since 2001. This annual lec- ture course is aimed at students in the first phase of their studies. Most are enrolled in physics degrees and choose astronomy as one of their subjects. This series of lec- tures forms the second part of the introductory course, and since the majority of students have previously at- tended the first part, I therefore assume that they have acquired a basic knowledge of astronomical nomencla- ture and conventions, as well as of the basic properties of stars. Thus, in this part of the course, I concentrate mainly on extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, be- ginning with a discussion of our Milky Way as a typical (spiral) galaxy. To extend the potential readership of this book to a larger audience, the basics of astronomy and relevant facts about radiation fields and stars are summarized in the appendix.
The goal of the lecture course, and thus also of this book, is to confront physics students with astronomy early in their studies. Since their knowledge of physics is limited in their first year, many aspects of the material covered here need to be explained with simplified argu- ments. However, it is surprising to what extent modern extragalactic astronomy can be treated with such ar- guments. All the material in this book is covered in the lecture course, though not all details are written up here. I believe that only by covering this wide range of topics can the students be guided to the forefront of our present astrophysical knowledge. Hence, they learn a lot about issues which are currently not settled and under intense discussion. It is also this aspect which I consider of great importance for the role of astronomy in the framework of a physics program, since in most other sub-disciplines of physics the limits of our cur- rent knowledge are approached only at a later stage in the studentâ€™s education.
